# Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of the second degree, meaning it contains at least one term that is squared, Its standard form is:

$$
ax2+bx+c=0
$$

a - quadratic coefficient

b - linear coefficient 

c - constant term

There are 3 methods to solve a quadratic equation 

1. factoring
2. completing the square
3. quadratic formula

Following steps can be done to solve this 

1. **Identify that the provided equation is a quadratic equation**
2. **Find the factors of the quadratic coefficient and the constant term**
3. **Identify two numbers that multiply to give the product of the quadratic coefficient and the constant term, and add up to the coefficient of the linear term.**
4. **Rewrite the middle term using the two numbers found in the previous step**
5. **Group the terms**
6. **Factor by grouping**
7. **Factor out the common binomial factor**
