# Number theory

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers

Here are some key topics and concepts in number theory:

**Prime Numbers**: Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

**Composite Numbers**: Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime.

**Divisibility**: Divisibility rules determine whether one number divides evenly into another. For example, a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.

**Modular Arithmetic**: Modular arithmetic deals with the remainder when one integer is divided by another. It's often used in cryptography and computer science.

**Congruence**: Two integers are congruent modulo mm if they have the same remainder when divided by mm. Congruence is an important concept in number theory.

**Diophantine Equations**: These are equations in which only integer solutions are sought. For example, $x^2+y^2 = z^2$ is a famous Diophantine equation known as the Pythagorean theorem.
