# Selector chaining

When writing CSS rules, itâ€™s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.

This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a `special` class for `<h1>` elements, the CSS would look like below:

```css
h1.special {

}
```

The code above would select only the `<h1>` elements with a class of `special`. If a `<p>` element also had a class of `special`, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.

Adding more than one tag, class, or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.
