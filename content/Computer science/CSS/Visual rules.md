# Visual rules

- The [`font-family`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-family) property defines the typeface of an element.
- [`font-size`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-size) controls the size of text displayed.
- [`font-weight`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/font-weight) defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
- The [`text-align`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/typography/text-align) property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
- Text can have two different color attributes: [`color`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/colors/color) and [`background-color`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/background/background-color). `color` defines the color of the text, while `background-color` defines the color behind the text.
- CSS can make an element transparent with the [`opacity`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/colors/opacity) property.
- CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the [`background-image`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/background/background-image) property.
- The `!important` flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override
