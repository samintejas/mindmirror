# EC2

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.Â 

With traditional on-premises resources, you have to do the following:

- Spend money upfront to purchase hardware.
- Wait for the servers to be delivered to you.
- Install the servers in your physical data center.
- Make all the necessary configurations.

By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.

- You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
- You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
- You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
- You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
