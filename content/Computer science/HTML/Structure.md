# Structure

HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.  When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the *child* of that element. The child element is said to be *nested* inside of the *parent* element.

Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be 
extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The 
relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements
 is known as *hierarchy*.

the child elements will inherit properties of parent element.
