# Divs

One of the most popular elements in HTML is the `<div>` element. [`<div>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/div?page_ref=catalog)is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
    <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

`<div>`s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements. `<div>`s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside. We can also style the `<div>` element as a whole.
