# Semantic HTML

When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML and *Semantic HTML*.The word semantic means “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing tags. 

For example, instead of using a `<div>` element to contain our header information, we could use a `<header>` element, which is used as a heading section. By using a `<header>` tag instead of a `<div>`, we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.

**Why use Semantic HTML?**

- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for
people with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and
browsers are able to interpret the code better.
- **SEO:** It improves the website SEO, or *Search Engine Optimization*, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify
the content of your website and weight the most important content
appropriately.
- **Easy to Understand:** Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read for other web developers.

- `<header>`, `<nav>` , `<main>` and `<footer>` create the basic structure of the webpage.
- `<section>` defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
- `<article>` holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
- `<aside>` contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
- `<figure>` encapsulates all types of media.
- `<figcaption>` is used to describe the media in `<figure>`.
- `<video>`, `<embed>`, and `<audio>` elements are used for media files.
