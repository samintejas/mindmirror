# SQL Databases

This required data model and format before data persistance , which will reduce error and improve consistency

SQL are ACID complient which means it is 

A - All or nothing transaction (Automicity)

C - consistency (Data is valid before or after)

I - Isolation (Multiple transaction at same time)

D - Durablity - Commited data is never lost

cons : more time to setup compared to NoSql databases

difficult to scale horzontanally because of the relational nature
