# Nouns

Nouns are words that represent ****people, places, things, or ideas. They can be concrete (e.g., book, table, dog) or **abstract** (e.g., love, happiness, idea). Nouns can function as the subject of a sentence, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.

Abstract nouns refer to ideas, concepts, emotions, or qualities that cannot be perceived through the five senses. e.g. sadness , freedom, success, beauty, honesty. Depending on the sentence some words can be considered as abstract noun and [verb](Verb%203c57c3bd47374d44901df7f78c3da420.md). e.g., in “*Their relationship was built on love and trust”*  Love is abstract noun and in *“i love apple”* love is a verb.

*”Ellie sits on the chair and he takes a walk”* in this example , Ellie is the subject of verb sits. chair is the object of [preposition](Preposition%20e8bfb008a63c487c978e2419ce7d19c0.md) on and walk is an object of verb takes.

**Common noun** : This is a generalized noun , example : student

**Proper noun** : this is a specific noun , example : Mary (for proper nouns we use capital letter) 

**Pronouns**: Pronouns are words used in place of nouns to avoid repetition. They can represent specific people or things (e.g., I, you, he, she, it) or be more general (e.g., everyone, everything). Pronouns can function as the subject, object, or possessive in a sentence.

Noun can also be singular or plural, singular means just one subject and plural means many. add an `s`, `es` or `ies` to many a singular to plural

- for most we use `s`
- if the word is ending with `-s`, `-ch`, `-sh`, `-x` and `-z` use `es`
- for words ending with consonants and `y` , drop the y and add `ies`

ex : 

boy → boys
box → boxes
baby → babies (dropping y because y is added to a consonant) 

monkey → monkeys (here y is added to a vowel instead of a consonant)

some are just different , ex : men , women , children ,people , teeth . leaves , mice (there is no definition for this) 

singular noun rules : 
we add articles before a singular noun , ex : `a` `an` , well use an before a vowel sound 

in a sentence we put adjective before nouns and articles before adjectives ,we can also have multiple adjective before a noun , ex : “tom is a big fat grey cat”
