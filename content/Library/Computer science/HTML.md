# HTML

HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as [images](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/images), text, or [videos](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/videos). 

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

- A *markup* language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
- In HTML, the computer can interpret *raw text* that is wrapped in HTML [elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements).
- *HyperText* is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through [links](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/links), also known as *hyperlinks*.
