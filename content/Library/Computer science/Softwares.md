# Softwares

A **program** is a set of instructions given to a computer in a specific programming language to accomplish a specific task
**software** is a collection of programs

Types of software's : 

- system software's - used to manage devices , acts as a intermediary between user and hardware and giving an environment for application software's (example : device drivers, BIOS,OS (operating system) , OS manages the resource and activities in a system, application software's interact with OS)
- application software's - these are non essential software's for the device functionality and domain specific (example browser)

OS

Program execution : 

1. Program is saved in disk
2. program is compiled and saved again in disk
3. OS loads the compiled program into the ram
4. once it is loaded and resources are available , program is executed line by line on the processor

A programming language is a well-defined set of rules and constructs that enables us to write programs to be executed by a computer. We need a way to give instructions to a computer for execution, and a programming language acts as the language in which we give instructions. In other words, a programming language is a language in which we can communicate with a computer. Examples of programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. 

Because of ambiguity and complexity natural languages cant be used for programing.

There are two types of programming languages: *compiler-based* and *interpreter-based* programming languages.

*compiler-based*  - compiled before running the app ex : C , Java

*interpreter-based  -* compiled during runtime : ex python , JS
