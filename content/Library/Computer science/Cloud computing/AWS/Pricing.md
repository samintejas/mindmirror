The [**AWS Pricing Calculator**](https://calculator.aws/#/) lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

## **AWS Budgets**

In [**AWS Budgets**](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets), you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.

## **AWS Cost Explorer**

[**AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/)** is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.
