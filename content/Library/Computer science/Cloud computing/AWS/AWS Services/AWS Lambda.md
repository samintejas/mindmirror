# AWS Lambda

If you have applications that you want to run in Amazon EC2, you must do the following:

1. Provision instances (virtual servers).
2. Upload your code.
3. Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.

The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.

Another benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically. Serverless computing can adjust the applications' capacity by modifying 
the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory. An AWS service for serverless computing is **AWS Lambda**.

While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.
