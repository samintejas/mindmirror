# Job roles

## Cloud Architect

The Cloud Architect is responsible for delivering an overall cloud strategy and is in charge of the entire cloud environment. The Cloud Architect builds a business’s cloud architecture blueprint to deliver highly available, cost-efficient, and scalable cloud environments. This role supervises deployment in the cloud environment and application architecture for all aspects of the cloud. It is critical that a Cloud Architect is knowledgeable enough to be your business’s AWS Cloud subject matter expert and the go-to for anything related to the cloud.

## **System Administrator**

The System Administrator is responsible for overall performance of cloud systems. They are the glue that keeps systems working together by managing configurations, completing detailed tasks, and assisting Database Administrators with setting up database servers in the cloud.

A System Administrator in the cloud maintains data integrity by deploying, configuring, and monitoring hybrid and cloud solutions instead of infrastructure performance and maintenance.

It’s essential that the System Administrator is adaptable and proficient with configuration management, requirements gathering, deployment planning, and completing detailed hands-on tasks.

## **Security Administrator**

Security *in* the cloud (as in the shared responsibility model) is the Security Administrator’s primary responsibility. 

A Security Administrator must be someone that is trusted and exceptionally knowledgeable because they are responsible for the overall integrity, confidentiality, and protection of data and resources in the cloud.

This role is a combination of reactive (investigates when security incidents or concerns are reported) and proactive (puts standards and development processes in place to reduce the number of security incidents). While the Security Administrator does not need to know all of the details of cloud operations, they do define security requirements based on their company’s security and regulatory requirements.

To ensure security *in* the cloud, the Security Administrator must have a deep understanding of  security rules and requirements applicable to their unique business. They must be highly resourceful, because it isn’t possible to memorize every rule or regulation. This role communicates these requirements down to engineers and up to decision makers to understand and address 
security risks.

## **DevOps Administrator**

The DevOps Administrator optimizes the use of the AWS Cloud. They help businesses operate at a larger, faster scale by managing developers and orchestrating the numerous tools and stages in the pipeline.

This role creates and maintains processes so that teams and developers can follow the model of small, rapid releases. To do this, this role manages the release cycle to ensure that there is enough pipeline to evaluate changes that need to be made, tested, and pushed to production. Additionally, the DevOps Administrator conducts tests and backs out changes if there are issues. They have the ability to quickly roll back changes if something doesn’t work.

Because the DevOps Administrator is responsible for orchestrating the pipeline, this role must be proficient with programming scripting languages, operations, QA, and testing.
