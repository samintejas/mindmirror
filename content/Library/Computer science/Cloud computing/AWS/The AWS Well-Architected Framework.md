# The AWS Well-Architected Framework

The [**AWS Well-Architected Framework**(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
 helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, 
efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a 
way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best 
practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.

The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:

- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance efficiency
- Cost optimization
- Sustainability

**Operational excellence**
 is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and
 to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Design
 principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing 
operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and 
frequently making small, reversible changes.

The **Security**
 pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while
 delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation 
strategies.

When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:

- Automate security best practices when possible.
- Apply security at all layers.
- Protect data in transit and at rest.

**Reliability** is the ability of a system to do the following:

- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

Reliability
 includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase 
aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from 
failure.

**Performance efficiency**
 is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system 
requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and 
technologies evolve.

Evaluating the performance 
efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using
 serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global
 in minutes.

**Cost optimization** is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.****

Cost
 optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and 
attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost 
of ownership.

In December 2021, AWS introduced a sustainability pillar as part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Sustainability
 is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by 
reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all 
components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned
 resources and minimizing the total resources required.

To facilitate good design for sustainability:

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
