# pseudo classes

You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different state, after certain user interactions. For instance:

- When you click on an `<input>` element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in *focus*.
- When you click on a blue `<a>` link to *visit* to another page, but when you return the link’s text is purple.
- When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and *disabled*. But when all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s *active*.

A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon `:` followed by a name. For example `p:hover`.
