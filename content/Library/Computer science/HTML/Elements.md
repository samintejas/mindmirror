# Elements

HTML is composed of [elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements?page_ref=catalog). These elements structure the webpage and define its content.
A *tag* and the *content* between it is called an HTML element. There can be tags which are self closing for example the [image](Elements%201fcf9aa878034653a7bef00ab694773a/Images%204a16c568d66843a294bce8c237ab4c4e.md) tag

Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, `class` is the attribute *name* and `editor-note` is the attribute *value*. The `class` attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same `class` value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as [`required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required).

Attributes that set a value always have:

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
