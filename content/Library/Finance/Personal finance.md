# Personal finance

- **Track your income and expenses:** Understanding where your money goes is crucial. List your income sources (salary, side hustles) and expenses (rent, groceries, entertainment).
- **Set financial goals:** What do you want to achieve? This could be anything from building an emergency fund to saving for a down payment on a house or a dream vacation. Having clear goals will help you stay motivated.
- **Create a budget:** Once you know your income and expenses, allocate funds towards your goals. A realistic budget will factor in necessities, savings, and some fun money. There are many budgeting methods you can find online.
- **Emergency fund:** Life throws curveballs. Aim to save 3-6 months of living expenses to cover unexpected costs like car repairs or medical bills.
- **Debt management:** High-interest debt can be a burden. Prioritize paying it off while managing minimum payments on other debts. There are strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche method to consider.
