# Representations

We can represent sets in 2 ways Roster or tabular form  and  Set builder form

### Roster or tabular form

here we represent sets inside curly braces where elements are separated by comma. ex : $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
The **order of the elements are not important** but there **cannot be repeated elements**

### Set builder form

All the elements of a set possess a single common property that is not possessed by any element outside the set.
example : for set $\{a,e,i,o,u\}$ we can denote it in set builder form as $V = \{x : x \: is \: a \: vovel \: in \: english \: alphabet \}$
