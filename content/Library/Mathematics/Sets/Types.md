# Types

### Empty set or Null set

Empty set have no element , its denoted by $\emptyset$  or $\{\}$ , 
**Example**: $\emptyset = \{x \mid x \text{ is a number greater than 3 and less than 2}\}$

### Finite set

If there are finite number of elements , then it is Finite set
**Example**: $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$

### Infinite Set

If there are infinite number of elements , then it is Infinite set

**Example : $N$**

### Equal Sets

Two sets that contain exactly the same elements. i.e. $A = B$

**Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\} \ , \ B = \{1, 2, 3\}$  then $A$ and $B$ are equal.

### **Equivalent Sets**

Two sets that have the same number of elements (cardinality). i.e. $|A| = |B|$
**Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\} \ , \ B = \{a, b, c\}$  then $A$ and $B$ are equivalent

### Subset

A set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. 

 $ie.\: A \subseteq B$ 

**Example**: $B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \ ,\ A = \{2, 3\}$ then $A \subseteq B$

### **Proper Subset**

A set $A$ is a proper subset of set $B$ if every element of $A$ is in $B$, and $A \neq B$ .

### Universal set

The set that contains all objects under consideration for a particular discussion or problem. denoted by $U$.

**Example**: For a discussion on natural numbers less than 5, the universal set could be $U = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$

### Power Set

The set of all subsets of a set AAA, including AAA and the empty set. denoted by $P(A)$

**Example**: if $A = \{1, 2\}$  then $P(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$

### Singleton set

A set containing exactly 1 element, i.e. $A = \{a\}$
