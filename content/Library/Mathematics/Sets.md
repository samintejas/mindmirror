# Sets

A **set** is defined as a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects in a set are called the **elements** or **members** of the set.
If $a$ is an element of set $A$, we write $a\in A$. If $b$ is not an element of set $A$, we write $b \notin A$.

N : the set of all natural numbers
Z : the set of all integers
Q : the set of all rational numbers (numbers that can be represented as $\frac{a}{b}$, where a and b are integers)
R : the set of real numbers
Z+ : the set of positive integers
Q+ : the set of positive rational numbers, and
R+ : the set of positive real numbers.

### 4. **Cardinality of Sets**

- **Finite Sets**: Learn how to count the number of elements in a set.
- **Infinite Sets**: Understand the concept of countably infinite and uncountably infinite sets.
- **Cardinality**: The number of elements in a set, denoted ∣A∣.
    
    ∣A∣|A|
    

### 5. **Advanced Topics (Optional)**

- **Indexed Sets**: Sets labeled with indices, commonly used in sequences and series.
- **Partitions of Sets**: Dividing a set into disjoint subsets.

## Tools for Practice

- **Set Theory Solvers and Visualizers**: Online tools to help you visualize and solve set problems.
- **Math Software**: Tools like WolframAlpha, GeoGebra, or even Python libraries (like SymPy) can help to explore sets more interactively.
