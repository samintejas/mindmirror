# Prime Factorization

Prime Factorization is the process of expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.

> **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**
Any integer greater than 1 is either a prime number, or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

### Ways to find prime factorization

1. **Trial Division**: This is the simplest method for factorizing integers. It involves testing each potential divisor to see if it divides the given integer evenly. While straightforward, it becomes inefficient for large numbers, especially when the divisors are large primes.

Steps : 
1. Take root of the number
2. round up the result
3. do divisibility test for all those number

2. **Pollard's Rho Algorithm**
3. **Fermat's Factorization Method**
4. **Quadratic Sieve (QS)**
5. **General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)**
6. **Elliptic Curve Factorization**
7. **Special Number Sieve**
