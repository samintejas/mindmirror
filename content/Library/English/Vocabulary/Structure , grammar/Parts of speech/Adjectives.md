# Adjectives

Adjectives are used to describe a noun .  Adjectives modify or describe nouns or pronouns by providing more information about their qualities or characteristics. They answer questions such as "what kind?", "which one?", or "how many?" (e.g., beautiful, blue, three). Adjectives usually come before the noun they modify.
