1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Make sure that the subject and verb in a sentence agree in number (singular or plural). For example, "The cat sleeps" (singular subject) versus "The cats sleep" (plural subject).
2. **Punctuation**: Learn the rules for using punctuation marks such as periods, commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, apostrophes, and question marks. Punctuation helps clarify the meaning of a sentence and guides readers on how to interpret it.
3. **Capitalization**: Understand when to capitalize words, such as the first word of a sentence, proper nouns (names of specific people, places, and things), and titles.
4. **Articles**: Learn how to use articles (a, an, the) correctly in sentences. Articles help specify whether a noun is referring to something specific or nonspecific.
5. **Modifiers**: Understand how to use adjectives and adverbs to modify nouns and verbs, respectively. Make sure modifiers are placed correctly in a sentence to avoid confusion.
6. **Phrasal Verbs and Idioms**: Familiarize yourself with common phrasal verbs (verbs followed by prepositions or adverbs) and idiomatic expressions. These can add nuance to your language and help you sound more natural.
7. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Practice writing sentences, reading English texts, and speaking with others in English. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with English grammar.
