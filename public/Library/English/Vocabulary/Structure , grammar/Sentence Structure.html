    <h1 id="sentence-structure">Sentence Structure</h1>
<p>Learn about the structure of sentences, including subjects, predicates, objects, and modifiers. Understanding how sentences are constructed will help you create clear and grammatically correct sentences.</p>
<p>Every sentence starts with Uppercase letter.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: The subject is the person, thing, or entity that performs the action of the verb or is described by the predicate. It typically answers the question &quot;who&quot; or &quot;what&quot; is doing something in the sentence. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary (subject) baked (verb) a cake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predicate</strong>: The predicate is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and provides information about the subject. It includes the verb and all the words that modify or complete the action or state of the subject. For example:</p>
<p><a href="Sentence%20Structure%20ff112f1e7123439c80279dcb436b6b85/Predicate%20examples%201ada5b452f6843f6824fc891cb4eb128.html">Predicate examples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Object</strong>: The direct object is the noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb directly. It answers the question &quot;whom&quot; or &quot;what&quot; after the verb. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary baked a cake (direct object).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indirect Object</strong>: The indirect object is the noun or pronoun that receives the direct object. It answers the question &quot;to whom&quot; or &quot;for whom&quot; or &quot;to what&quot; or &quot;for what&quot; the action is done. Not all sentences have indirect objects. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary baked her friend (indirect object) a cake (direct object).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modifiers</strong>: Modifiers are words or phrases that provide additional information about other elements in the sentence. They can modify nouns (adjectives), verbs (adverbs), or entire clauses (adverbial clauses). Modifiers help provide context and detail to the sentence. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The delicious (modifier) chocolate cake (subject) was baked (verb) by Mary (modifier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subject Complement</strong>: A subject complement is a word or phrase that follows a linking verb (such as &quot;is,&quot; &quot;are,&quot; &quot;was,&quot; &quot;were&quot;) and renames or describes the subject. It provides more information about the subject. For example:<br />
this is also referred as BE verb</p>
<ul>
<li>She is a baker (subject complement).</li>
<li>She’s a baker (’s is called a contraction).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Clause Structure</strong>: Sentences can be simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex based on the number and type of clauses they contain. A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate. Understanding how to combine clauses can create varied and effective sentence structures.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>In English we need subject in every sentence</p>
