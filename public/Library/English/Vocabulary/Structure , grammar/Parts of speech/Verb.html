<p><strong>Verbs</strong>: Verbs express actions, states, or occurrences. They are the core of a sentence and typically indicate what the subject is doing (e.g., run, jump, eat) or the state of being (e.g., is, are, were). Verbs can also indicate tense (past, present, future) and can be modified by auxiliary verbs (e.g., can, will, have).</p>
