<li><strong>Subject-Verb Agreement</strong>: Make sure that the subject and verb in a sentence agree in number (singular or plural). For example, &quot;The cat sleeps&quot; (singular subject) versus &quot;The cats sleep&quot; (plural subject).</li>
<li><strong>Punctuation</strong>: Learn the rules for using punctuation marks such as periods, commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, apostrophes, and question marks. Punctuation helps clarify the meaning of a sentence and guides readers on how to interpret it.</li>
<li><strong>Capitalization</strong>: Understand when to capitalize words, such as the first word of a sentence, proper nouns (names of specific people, places, and things), and titles.</li>
<li><strong>Articles</strong>: Learn how to use articles (a, an, the) correctly in sentences. Articles help specify whether a noun is referring to something specific or nonspecific.</li>
<li><strong>Modifiers</strong>: Understand how to use adjectives and adverbs to modify nouns and verbs, respectively. Make sure modifiers are placed correctly in a sentence to avoid confusion.</li>
<li><strong>Phrasal Verbs and Idioms</strong>: Familiarize yourself with common phrasal verbs (verbs followed by prepositions or adverbs) and idiomatic expressions. These can add nuance to your language and help you sound more natural.</li>
<li><strong>Practice, Practice, Practice</strong>: Practice writing sentences, reading English texts, and speaking with others in English. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with English grammar.</li>
