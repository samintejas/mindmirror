<ul>
<li><strong>Track your income and expenses:</strong> Understanding where your money goes is crucial. List your income sources (salary, side hustles) and expenses (rent, groceries, entertainment).</li>
<li><strong>Set financial goals:</strong> What do you want to achieve? This could be anything from building an emergency fund to saving for a down payment on a house or a dream vacation. Having clear goals will help you stay motivated.</li>
<li><strong>Create a budget:</strong> Once you know your income and expenses, allocate funds towards your goals. A realistic budget will factor in necessities, savings, and some fun money. There are many budgeting methods you can find online.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency fund:</strong> Life throws curveballs. Aim to save 3-6 months of living expenses to cover unexpected costs like car repairs or medical bills.</li>
<li><strong>Debt management:</strong> High-interest debt can be a burden. Prioritize paying it off while managing minimum payments on other debts. There are strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche method to consider.</li>
</ul>
