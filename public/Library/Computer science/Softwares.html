<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions given to a computer in a specific programming language to accomplish a specific task<br />
<strong>software</strong> is a collection of programs</p>
<p>Types of software's :</p>
<ul>
<li>system software's - used to manage devices , acts as a intermediary between user and hardware and giving an environment for application software's (example : device drivers, BIOS,OS (operating system) , OS manages the resource and activities in a system, application software's interact with OS)</li>
<li>application software's - these are non essential software's for the device functionality and domain specific (example browser)</li>
</ul>
<p>OS</p>

<p>Program execution :</p>
<ol>
<li>Program is saved in disk</li>
<li>program is compiled and saved again in disk</li>
<li>OS loads the compiled program into the ram</li>
<li>once it is loaded and resources are available , program is executed line by line on the processor</li>
</ol>
<p>A programming language is a well-defined set of rules and constructs that enables us to write programs to be executed by a computer. We need a way to give instructions to a computer for execution, and a programming language acts as the language in which we give instructions. In other words, a programming language is a language in which we can communicate with a computer. Examples of programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Because of ambiguity and complexity natural languages cant be used for programing.</p>
<p>There are two types of programming languages: <em>compiler-based</em> and <em>interpreter-based</em> programming languages.</p>
<p><em>compiler-based</em>  - compiled before running the app ex : C , Java</p>
<p><em>interpreter-based  -</em> compiled during runtime : ex python , JS</p>
