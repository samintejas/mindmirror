<p>HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.  When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the <em>child</em> of that element. The child element is said to be <em>nested</em> inside of the <em>parent</em> element.</p>
<p>Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be<br />
extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The<br />
relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements<br />
is known as <em>hierarchy</em>.</p>
<p>the child elements will inherit properties of parent element.</p>
