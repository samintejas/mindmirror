<p>Here, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype">doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young<br />
(around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules<br />
that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these<br />
days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
<li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> — the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is<br />
sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the <code>lang</code> attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
<li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> — the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that <em>isn't</em> the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Keyword">keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS<br />
to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
<li><code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</code> — This element sets the<br />
character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most<br />
characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it<br />
can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no<br />
reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
<li><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;</code> — This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts#mobile_viewports">viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile<br />
browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
<li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> — the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that<br />
appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to<br />
describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
<li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> — the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains <em>all</em> the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your<br />
page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
</ul>
