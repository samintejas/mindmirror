    <h1 id="selector-chaining">Selector chaining</h1>
<p>When writing CSS rules, itâ€™s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.</p>
<p>This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a <code>special</code> class for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements, the CSS would look like below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">h1.special {

}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above would select only the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements with a class of <code>special</code>. If a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element also had a class of <code>special</code>, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.</p>
<p>Adding more than one tag, class, or ID to a CSS selector increases the specificity of the CSS selector.</p>
