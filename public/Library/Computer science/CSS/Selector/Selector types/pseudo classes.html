<p>You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can change, or be in a different state, after certain user interactions. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you click on an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, and a blue border is added showing that it is in <em>focus</em>.</li>
<li>When you click on a blue <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link to <em>visit</em> to another page, but when you return the link’s text is purple.</li>
<li>When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed out and <em>disabled</em>. But when all of the fields have been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s <em>active</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon <code>:</code> followed by a name. For example <code>p:hover</code>.</p>
