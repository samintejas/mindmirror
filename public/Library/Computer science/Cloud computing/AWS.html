<p>The traditional on-premises model for managing IT applications and infrastructure is highly manual and often uses expensive equipment at less than full capacity.</p>
<p>AWS provides</p>
<p>Speed: With the AWS Cloud, organizations can experiment with applications and new business models at lower cost and greater speed.</p>
<p>Scale: The AWS Cloud creates opportunities for organizations to scale products almost instantaneously to a broader set of customer segments, geographies, and channels.</p>
<p>Innovation: Using the AWS Cloud means that roles that were once required for on premises will move to a shared responsibility model. This frees up your team to innovate and use technologies such as advanced analytics, the Internet of Things, or IoT, and automation at scale.</p>
<p>Productivity: The adoption of cloud principles such as infrastructure and security as code helps to automate compliance and other routine processes, which speeds up productivity.</p>
