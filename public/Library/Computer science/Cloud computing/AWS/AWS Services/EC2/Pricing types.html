    <h1 id="pricing-types">Pricing types</h1>
<h2 id="on-demand-instances"><strong>On-Demand Instances</strong></h2>
<p>are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.</p>
<p>Sample use cases for On-Demand Instances include developing and testing applications and  running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns. On-Demand Instances are not recommended for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience greater cost savings using Reserved Instances.</p>
<h2 id="reserved-instances"><strong>Reserved Instances</strong></h2>
<p>are a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. There are two available types of Reserved Instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Reserved Instances</li>
<li>Convertible Reserved Instances</li>
</ul>
<p>You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term. You realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Reserved Instances</strong>:<br />
This option is a good fit if you know the EC2 instance type and size you need for your steady-state applications and in which AWS Region you plan to run them. Reserved Instances require you to state the following qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instance type and size:</strong> For example, m5.xlarge</li>
<li><strong>Platform description (operating system):</strong> For example, Microsoft Windows Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>
<li><strong>Tenancy:</strong> Default tenancy or dedicated tenancy</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to specify an Availability Zone for your EC2 Reserved Instances. If you make this specification, you get EC2 capacity reservation. This ensures that your desired amount of EC2 instances will be available when you need them.</p>
<p><strong>Convertible Reserved Instances</strong>:<br />
If you need to run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types, then Convertible Reserved Instances might be right for you. Note: You trade in a deeper discount when you require flexibility to run your EC2 instances.</p>
<p>At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. However, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminate the instance.</li>
<li>Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance family and size, Region, platform, and tenancy).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="savings-plans"><strong>Savings Plans</strong></h2>
<p>AWS offers Savings Plans for a few compute services, including Amazon EC2. <strong>EC2 Instance Savings Plans</strong> reduce your EC2 instance costs when you make an hourly spend commitment to an instance family and Region for a 1-year or 3-year term. This term commitment results in savings of up to 72 percent compared to On-Demand rates. Any usage up to the commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plans rate (for example, $10 per hour). Any usage beyond the<br />
commitment is charged at regular On-Demand rates.</p>
<h2 id="spot-instance">Spot instance</h2>
<p><strong>Spot Instances</strong> are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.</p>
<h2 id="dedicated-hosts"><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use.</p>
<p>You can use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance. You can purchase On-Demand Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Hosts Reservations. Of all the Amazon EC2 options that were covered, Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.</p>
