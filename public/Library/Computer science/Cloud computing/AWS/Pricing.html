<p>The <a href="https://calculator.aws/#/"><strong>AWS Pricing Calculator</strong> lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.</p>
<h2 id="aws-budgets"><strong>AWS Budgets</strong></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets"><strong>AWS Budgets</strong>, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.</p>
<p>The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.</p>
<p>In AWS Budgets, you can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budgeted amount.</p>
<h2 id="aws-cost-explorer"><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">**AWS Cost Explorer** is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.</p>
<p>AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.</p>
