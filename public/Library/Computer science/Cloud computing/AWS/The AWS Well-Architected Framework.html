<p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html"><strong>AWS Well-Architected Framework</strong>(opens in a new tab)<br />
helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure,<br />
efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a<br />
way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best<br />
practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.</p>

<p>The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operational excellence</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Performance efficiency</li>
<li>Cost optimization</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational excellence</strong><br />
is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and<br />
to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.</p>
<p>Design<br />
principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing<br />
operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and<br />
frequently making small, reversible changes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Security</strong><br />
pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while<br />
delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation<br />
strategies.</p>
<p>When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate security best practices when possible.</li>
<li>Apply security at all layers.</li>
<li>Protect data in transit and at rest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong> is the ability of a system to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions</li>
<li>Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand</li>
<li>Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliability<br />
includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase<br />
aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from<br />
failure.</p>
<p><strong>Performance efficiency</strong><br />
is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system<br />
requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and<br />
technologies evolve.</p>
<p>Evaluating the performance<br />
efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using<br />
serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global<br />
in minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Cost optimization</strong> is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.****</p>
<p>Cost<br />
optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and<br />
attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost<br />
of ownership.</p>
<p>In December 2021, AWS introduced a sustainability pillar as part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.</p>
<p>Sustainability<br />
is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by<br />
reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all<br />
components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned<br />
resources and minimizing the total resources required.</p>
<p>To facilitate good design for sustainability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand your impact</li>
<li>Establish sustainability goals</li>
<li>Maximize utilization</li>
<li>Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings</li>
<li>Use managed services</li>
<li>Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads</li>
</ul>
