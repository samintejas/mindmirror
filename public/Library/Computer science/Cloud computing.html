<p><strong>Cloud computing is a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service using Internet technologies.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/">Types of Cloud Computing - SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS - AWS</p>
<p>there are basically 3 kinds of deployments</p>
<ul>
<li>cloud based - everything on cloud</li>
<li>on premise - its kind of legacy , data will be in private datacenters and using virtualization techs</li>
<li>hybrid - its a mix of cloud and on premise , for ex lets say we want to create a gov app , the data should not go to cloud that will be kept in on premise. or for another ex we want to integrate current legacy apps that are running on on premise to cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of using cloud :</p>
<ol>
<li>trade upfront expenses to variable expense</li>
<li>Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers</li>
<li>Stop guessing capacity as we can scale in and out on demand</li>
<li>can achieve higher economies of scale. The economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.</li>
<li>Increased speed and agility</li>
<li>Can distribute to global audience with minimal delay</li>
</ol>
