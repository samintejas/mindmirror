    <h1 id="number-theory">Number theory</h1>
<p>Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers</p>
<p>Here are some key topics and concepts in number theory:</p>
<p><strong>Prime Numbers</strong>: Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Composite Numbers</strong>: Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime.</p>
<p><strong>Divisibility</strong>: Divisibility rules determine whether one number divides evenly into another. For example, a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.</p>

<p><strong>Modular Arithmetic</strong>: Modular arithmetic deals with the remainder when one integer is divided by another. It's often used in cryptography and computer science.</p>
<p><strong>Congruence</strong>: Two integers are congruent modulo mm if they have the same remainder when divided by mm. Congruence is an important concept in number theory.</p>
<p><strong>Diophantine Equations</strong>: These are equations in which only integer solutions are sought. For example, $x^2+y^2 = z^2$ is a famous Diophantine equation known as the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
