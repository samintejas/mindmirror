<ul>
<li>Proposition - a declarative sentence that is either true or false , but not both. true is demotes by $T$ , false is denoted by $F$ and proposition variables are denoted by $p,q,r...$ or $p_1,p_2,p_3...$</li>
<li>Compound propositions are new propositions created from excising proposition using logical operators or connectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connectives</p>
<ul>
<li>Negation of proposition is denoted by $\neg p$, the truth value of the negation of $p$ is the opposite of truth value of $p$.</li>
<li>conjunction - lets take 2 proposition say p and q , the conjunction ($\land$) $p \land q$ is <em>“p and q”</em> as in logical and. it is true if both p and q are true</li>
<li>Disjunction ($\lor$) - it is like a logical or, it is false when both p and q are false otherwise true.</li>
<li>implication or conditional statement, $p \implies q$  (p implies q or p conditional q) is the proposition <em>“if p, then q” . $p \implies q$</em> is false when p is true and q is false. here p is called hypothesis and q is called conclusion.</li>
<li>converse , $q \implies p$ is the converse of $p \implies q$</li>
<li>contrapositive , $\neg q \implies \neg p$ is the contrapositive of $p \implies q$</li>
</ul>
